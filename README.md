## How to run notebooks or train a model

If you wish to learn a new model or to run the notebooks, you can do so by
installing an environment:

```bash:
bin/setup
```

You should have a local docker installation and an internet connection
available.

You can now start the notebook:

```bash:
bin/notebook
```

If you do not have docker installed and have jupyter installed, you can
view this file by typing

```bash:
jupyter notebook
```
